### Steps
* Build (Dotnet 6 Required)
* Run As Administrator
* Enjoy.

Alternatively you can add a Task Scheduler script to have it auto start or throw it in your `shell:Startup` folder and get a UAC prompt each startup ;)

This was a quick fix to an annoying problem, I doubt many other people have this issue, due to this reason, there is a lack of documentation to the project.
